Fedora 18:
* chrony/ntp target?

Bugfixes:
* remove MS_SHARED from src/core/execute.c and src/test/test-ns.c. They are always combined
  with MS_REMOUNT, which currently does nothing in the kernel, but might which fail in the
  future; https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=813563

* check systemd-tmpfiles for selinux context hookup for mknod(), symlink() and similar

* swap units that are activated by one name but shown in the kernel under another are semi-broken

* make anaconda write timeout=0 for encrypted devices

* Dangling symlinks of .automount unit files in .wants/ directories, set up
  automount points even when the original .automount file did not exist
  anymore. Only the .mount unit was still around.

* make polkit checks async

* properly handle .mount unit state tracking when two mount points are stacked one on top of another on the exact same mount point.

* we pull src/core/manager.h into src/shared/src/shared/path-lookup.c which is the wrong direction
   rename enum "ManagerRunningAs" to "SystemdRunningAs" and move it to shared/

Features:

* add switch to journalctl to only show data from current boot

* change REquires=basic.target to RequisiteOverride=basic.target

* turn $NOTIFY_SOCKET back into an abstract namespace socket for
  compatibility with services which chroot()

* exclude processes marked with argv[0][0]=@ from the normal service killing too

* support rd.luks.allow-discards= kernel cmdline params in cryptsetup generator

* systemctl: when stopping a service which has triggres and warning about it actually check the TriggeredBy= deps fields

* journal: hook up with EFI firmware log, new kmsg logic

* handle C-A-Del in logind, like the power/suspend buttons?

* nspawn: make use of device cgroup contrller by default

* journalctl /dev/sda, journalctl --device=b12:8 (--device=n12, --device=+usb:1-1)

* make use of /sys/power/wake_lock in inhibitors

* drop accountsservice's StandardOutput=syslog and Type=dbus fields

* make sure show-logs checks for utf8 validity, not ascii validity

* when breaking cycles drop sysv services first, then services from /run, then from /etc, then from /usr

* readahead: when bumping /sys readahead variable save mtime and compare later to detect changes

* Document boot options such as forcefsck

* (attempt to) make Debianites happy:
        - implement .d/ auto includes for unit files
        - add syntax to reset ExecStart= lists (and similar)

* manipulate CPU governor during boot, set it to performance

* steal SBF management from the kernel

* delay journal /var writeout to after boot if SBF is clean

* move passno parsing to fstab generator

* improve !/proc/*/loginuid situation: make /proc/*/loginuid less dependent on CONFIG_AUDIT,
  or use the users cgroup information when /proc/*/loginuid is not available.

* pam_systemd: try to get old session id from cgroup, if audit sessionid cannot be determined

* pam: when leaving a session explicitly exclude the ReleaseSession() caller process from the killing spree

* maybe introduce ~/.config/locale.conf and apply it within PAM

* readahead: make use of EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT, as used by http://e4rat.sourceforge.net/

* automount: implement expire

* logind: auto-suspend, auto-shutdown:
        IdleAction=(none|suspend|opportunistic|hibernate|poweroff)
        IdleActionDelay=...
        SessionIdleMode=(explicit|ignore|login)
        ForceShutdown=(yes|no)

* services which create their own subcgroups break cgroup-empty notification (needs to be fixed in the kernel)

* don't delete /tmp/systemd-namespace-* before a process is gone down

* don't delete /run/users/lennart if lennart is still logged in even if aging is used

* vconsole: implement setterm -store -foreground xxx --background zzz

* ExecOnFailure=/usr/bin/foo

* fedora: make sshd and pam_loginuid work in nspawn containers

* fix utmp for console logins in containers

* Add pretty name for seats in logind

* nspawn wants dev_setup() for /dev/fd/ and friends?

* selinux: merge systemd selinux access controls (dwalsh)

* ConditionSecurity= should learn about IMA

* Auke: merge Auke's bootchart

* udev: move to LGPL

* udev systemd unify:
  - strpcpy(), strpcpyl(), strscpy(), strscpyl()
  - utf8 validator code
  - now() vs. now_usec()

* udev: remove network interface renaming, sleep and retry logic, we do
        no support renaming of interfaces in the conflicting kernel
        namespace

* udev: find a way to tell udev to not cancel firmware requests when running in initramfs

* udev: scsi_id -> sg3_utils -> kill scsi_id

* udev: add trigger --subsystem-match=usb/usb_device device

* allow configuration of console width/height in vconsole.conf

* cleanup syslog 'priority' vs. 'level' wording

* journal: if mmap() fails for mapping window try to unmap a a few older maps

* dbus upstream still refers to dbus.target and shouldn't

* when a service has the same env var set twice we actually store it twice and return that in systemctl show -p... We should only show the last setting

* support container_ttys=

* journald: make configurable "store-on-var", "store-on-run", "dont-store", "auto"
  (store-persistent, store-volatile?)

* introduce mix of BindTo and Requisite

* journalctl: show multiline log messages sanely, expand tabs, and show all valid utf8 messages

* add DeleteSocketsOnStop=yes|no option to socket units

* journal: store euid in journal if it differs from uid

* support chrony in addition to ntpd in timedated

* document crypttab(5)

* There's currently no way to cancel fsck (used to be possible via C-c or c on the console)

* journal: sanely deal with entries which are larger than the individual file size, but where the componets would fit

* add command to systemctl to plot dependency graph as tree (see rhbz 795365)

* make logind reserve tty9 or so for text logins, so that gdm never picks it up

* add option to sockets to avoid activation. Instead just drop packets/connections, see http://cyberelk.net/tim/2012/02/15/portreserve-systemd-solution/

* default unix qlen is too small (10). bump sysctl? add sockopt?

* Possibly, detect whether SysV init scripts can do reloading by looking for "echo Usage:" lines

* figure out whether we should leave dbus around during shutdown

* dbus: in fedora, make the machine a symlink to /etc/machine-id

* journald: reuse XZ context

* logind: add equivalent to sd_pid_get_owner_uid() to the D-Bus API

* write RPM spec macros for presets

* journal: write man pages for API

* journal: OR matches are borked

* systemctl journal command

* journalctl: --cursor support, priority filtering

* systemctl status: show coredumps

* save coredump in Windows/Mozilla minidump format

* support crash reporting operation modes (https://live.gnome.org/GnomeOS/Design/Whiteboards/ProblemReporting)

* clean up session cgroups that remain after logout (think sshd), but eventually run empty

* support "systemctl stop foobar@.service" to stop all units matching a certain template

* logind: allow showing logout dialog from system

* document that %% can be used to write % in a string that is specifier extended

* when an instanced service exits, remove its parent cgroup too if possible.

* automatically escape unit names passed on the service (i.e. think "systemctl start serial-getty.service@serial/by-path/jshdfjsdfhkjh" being automatically escaped as necessary.

* if we can not get user quota for tmpfs, mount a separate tmpfs instance
  for every user in /run/user/$USER with a configured maximum size

* default to actual 32bit PIDs, via /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

* add an option to make mounts private/shareable and so on, enable this for root by default

* be able to specify a forced restart of service A where service B depends on, in case B
  needs to be auto-respawned?

* Something is wrong with symlink handling of "autovt@.service" in "systemctl list-unit-files"

* when a bus name of a service disappears from the bus make sure to queue further activation requests

* something like ConditionExec= or ExecStartPre= without failure state

* tmpfiles: apply "x" on "D" too (see patch from William Douglas)

* don't set $HOME in services unless requested

* hide PAM/TCPWrap options in fragment parser when compile time disabled

* when we automatically restart a service, ensure we restart its rdeps, too.

* allow Type=simple with PIDFile=
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=723942

* move PAM code into its own binary

* warn if the user stops a service but not its associated socket

* logind: spawn user@..service on login

* logind: non-local X11 server handling

* implement Register= switch in .socket units to enable registration
  in Avahi, RPC and other socket registration services.

* make sure systemd-ask-password-wall does not shutdown systemd-ask-password-console too early

* readahead: use BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG_RANGE instead of BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG ioctl, with START_IO

* readahead: check whether a btrfs volume includes ssd by checking mount flag "ssd"

* support sd_notify() style notification when reload begins (RELOADING=1), reload is finished (READY=1), and add ReloadSignal= then to use in combination

* support sd_notify() style notification when shutting down, to make auto-exit bus services work (STOPPING=1)

* verify that the AF_UNIX sockets of a service in the fs still exist
  when we start a service in order to avoid confusion when a user
  assumes starting a service is enough to make it accessible

* Make it possible to set the keymap independently from the font on
  the kernel cmdline. Right now setting one resets also the other.

* move nss-myhostname into systemd

* and a dbus call to generate target from current state

* drop /.readahead on bigger upgrades with yum

* add support for /bin/mount -s

* GC unreferenced jobs (such as .device jobs)

* when failing to start a service due to ratelimiting, try again later, if restart=always is set

* write blog stories about:
  - enabling dbus services
  - status update
  - how to make changes to sysctl and sysfs attributes
  - remote access
  - how to pass throw-away units to systemd, or dynamically change properties of existing units
  - how to integrate cgconfig and suchlike with systemd
  - resource control in systemd
  - inhibiting
  - testing with Harald's awesome test kit
  - the Documentation=

* allow port=0 in .socket units

* move readahead files into /var, look for them with .path units

* when key file cannot be found, read it from kbd in cryptsetup

* reuse mkdtemp namespace dirs in /tmp?

* recreate systemd's D-Bus private socket file on SIGUSR2

* Support --test based on current system state

* investigate whether the gnome pty helper should be moved into systemd, to provide cgroup support.

* maybe introduce ExecRestartPre=

* configurable jitter for timer events

* timer events with system resume

* timer events on calendar time

* dot output for --test showing the 'initial transaction'

* calendar time support in timer, iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types
* exec settings override
* writable cgroups dbus properties for live changes

* read config fragments for all units from /lib/systemd/system/foobar.service.d/ to override/extend specific settings

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:
   - rpcbind (/var/run/rpcbind.sock!) HAVEPATCH
   - cups     HAVEPATCH
   - postfix, saslauthd
   - apache/samba
   - libvirtd (/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro)
   - bluetoothd (/var/run/sdp! @/org/bluez/audio!)
   - distccd

* auditd service files

* fingerprint.target, wireless.target, gps.target, netdevice.target

* io priority during initialization

* systemctl list-jobs - show dependencies

* add systemctl switch to dump transaction without executing it

* drop cap bounding set in readahead and other services

External:

* dbus:
   - dbus --user
   - natively watch for dbus-*.service symlinks (PENDING)
   - allow specification of socket mode/umask when allocating DBusServer
   - allow disabling of fd passing when connecting a AF_UNIX connection
   - allow disabling of UID passing for AUTH EXTERNAL
   - always pass cred data along each message

* fix alsa mixer restore to not print error when no config is stored

* gnome-shell python script/glxinfo/is-accelerated must die

* make cryptsetup lower --iter-time

* patch kernel for xattr support in /dev, /proc/, /sys and /sys/fs/cgroup?

* NTP: the kernel's 11-minutes-mode syncs the system time to the RTC, but only
  in an ~30 minutes window. It does not adjust larger differences. Find a way
  to tell the kernel, to always do a full time sync when the RTC is in UTC and
  we are in 11-minutes-mode. When we trust the system time to NTP we also want
  the RTC to sync up.

* kernel: add device_type = "fb", "fbcon" to class "graphics"

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)

* Use PR_SET_PROCTITLE_AREA if it becomes available in the kernel

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* pahole

* set_put(), hashmap_put() return values check. i.e. == 0 doesn't free()!

Scheduled for removal (or fixing):

* xxxOverridable dependencies
